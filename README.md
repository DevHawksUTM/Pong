# Pong

This repository is pretty self explanatory. It's pong...but really bad.

There's no menu, tutorial, internal instructions, or even an end to the game.

## Compiling Pong

To compile Pong: `make`

Then, to run Pong: `./pong`

Alternatively, you can compile & run pong in one command: `make run`

To delete the object files made in the process: `make clean`

## Controls

Each player has one side of the keyboard.

Player 1 (left) moves their paddle up using `Q` & down using `S`
Player 1 can also boost their paddle speed by holding `left-alt` or `left-ctrl`

Player 2 (right) moves their paddle up using `\` & down using `'`
Player 2 can also boost their paddle speed by holding `right-alt` or `right-ctrl`
